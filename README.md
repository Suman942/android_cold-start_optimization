# 🚀 Android Cold Start Optimization – Learnings

I reduced my app’s cold start time from **10–15 seconds** to ~3 seconds. Here I’m sharing techniques and insights.

## 📊 Before vs After
| Metric               | Before       | After        |
|----------------------|--------------|--------------|
| Cold Start Duration  | 10–15 seconds| ~3 seconds   |

## 💡 Key Techniques
✅ Lazy Initialization  
✅ App Startup Library  
✅ Move heavy work off Main Thread (Work manager or any other background thread)
✅ Splash Screen Optimization use Splash API
✅ Avoid nesting of layouts
<!-- ❌ Bad: Deep nesting -->
<LinearLayout>
    <LinearLayout>
        <TextView></TextView>
    </LinearLayout>
</LinearLayout>

<!-- ✅ Good: Flat hierarchy -->
<ConstraintLayout>
    <TextView></TextView>
</ConstraintLayout>

✅ Avoid heavy task in Application class if required use background thread
✅ Reduce APK size remove unnecessary medias
✅ Keep onCreate and onResume stress free
✅ Make sure GC not triggered initially (GC runs in main thread) which blocks the UI
✅ Try to Make Memory Efficient – Optimize memory usage at startup to avoid triggering Garbage Collection (GC) on the main thread. GC runs on the main thread and can freeze the UI if large objects are allocated during initialization.
✅ Prevent Garbage Collection (GC) at Startup – Related to memory efficiency, avoid large memory allocations early in the app lifecycle.



✅ Splash Screen Optimization – Use [SplashScreen API](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/ui/splash-screen)
